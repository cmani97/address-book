# Address-Book

1. Run the main.go file(`go run ./cmd/addressbook/main.go`) or binary file(`./addressbook`) to start the program
2. Provide your option to add or search contact
3. To search by name you need to provide the fullname -> `firstName lastName`
4. To make searchable easier, we are storing records by combination of `firstName+' '+lastName`
5. We can also make changes to search by either `firstName` or `lastName`, for this memory usage will be high. Because we need to store contact based on both `firstName` and `lastName`, to maintain performance

Sample output:

## Further Optimization:
### Concurrency:
#### The current implementation uses a simple read-write mutex for thread safety. For higher performance, especially with concurrent searches, consider using more advanced concurrency patterns or lock-free data structures.
